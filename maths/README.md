# Mathematic \*

Here you will find research papers, thesis that I find interesenting to share !

Most courses and resources are in french because they come from [Université Paris Cité](u-paris.fr) !

Don't forget to star this repo :)

> \* In singular, because there's only one mathématic as Cédric Villani, french Field Medal winner says in his book [Les Mathématiquez sont la poésie des Sciences](https://www.amazon.com/math%C3%A9matiques-sont-po%C3%A9sie-sciences-math%C3%A9matique/dp/2081422417)*
