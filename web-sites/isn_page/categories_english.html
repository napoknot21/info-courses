The Black Book on the Status of Women offers us, for the first time, a photograph of the status of women in the world today. In preamble to its Declaration of 1993, the UN proclaims the urgency of the application to women of the rights and principles of the human race: SECURITY, INTEGRITY, FREEDOM, DIGNITY, EQUALITY.

					<p> After the formal fall of the Soviet Union in 1992, many sectors of the free world rested on that triumphalism that gave the feeling that the collectivist utopia had lost forever. But a few years later, embracing new flags and reinventing his speech, the so-called neo-communism (or cultural progressivism) not only came to dominate the political agenda but largely the Western mentality. The old socialist principles of class struggle, dialectical materialism, proletarian revolution or guerrilla violence, were now replaced by a rare intellectual intake promoting "ecological indigenism," selective "right-humanism," "legal guarantee," and above all the things, for what is called "gender ideology", luck of pornomarxism of pansexual dye, promoter of radical feminism, ideological homosexuality, pedophilia as "alternative", abortion as "free disposition of the body" and all kinds of self-destructive habits as a form of rebellion in the face of «the hetero-capitalist tradition» of the West ....<a href="Fondo_trabajo.html"><p> Read All</p></a>

					<p>Daughter of Marie de Guise and Jacques V of Scotland, Marie became Queen of Scotland after the death of her father, when she was only six days old. The management of the kingdom is entrusted to regents, like his mother Marie de Guise as well as his cousin after the death of the regent; the queen grew up in France. In 1558, she married the future King François II, who rose to the throne the following year, thus renewing the Auld Alliance between the two countries. He died prematurely in 1560 and Marie Stuart returned to Scotland. Catholic queen in a country that has become Protestant, Marie is treated with distrust, even if she leads a moderate policy at first. Four years after her return, she married her second cousin, Lord Darnley, for a second wedding. The marriage was not happy despite the birth of a son, the future Jacques VI of Scotland and I of England...<a href="Fondo_trabajo.html"><p> Read All </p></a>
